# Nadeko-Scripts

These are just some Batch Scripts to install newer Nadeko Versions on Windows with changeable Source.  
 
FIRST: YOU NEED: [FFMPEG3.3.X](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) | [Youtube-DL](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)  | [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | [.net core 1.1.X](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.0.4-download.md)

THEN: Make Sure you've added Git, Youtube-DL, .net core and FFMPEG to your PATH  

AFTER THAT: Right Click at NadekoBot.bat and safe as a Batchfile (.bat)

[NadekoBot.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gremagol/Nadeko-Scripts/1.8/NadekoBot.bat)  

Now:  
 
Just run **NadekoBot.bat**  
 
Press 1 to download the latest 1.8 version. 

Anyways, after downloading NadekoBot, you will have to set your Crendentials up.  

If you finished that already, just start the bot with either the Second or Third Option. (Normal startup or Auto Restart)
