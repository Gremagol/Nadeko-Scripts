# Nadeko-Scripts

These are just some Batch Scripts to install newer Nadeko Versions on Windows with changeable Source.  
 
FIRST: YOU NEED: [FFMPEG3.3.X](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) [Youtube-DL](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [.net core 1.1.X](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.0.3-sdk-download.md)  

THEN: Make Sure you've added Git, Youtube-DL, .net core and FFMPEG to your PATH  

AFTER THAT: Download all 4 Scripts, just right-click them and save as .bat files.  

[NadekoBot.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gremagol/Nadeko-Scripts/master/NadekoBot.bat), [Download.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gremagol/Nadeko-Scripts/master/Download.bat), [Run.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gremagol/Nadeko-Scripts/master/Run.bat), [Run_AR.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gremagol/Nadeko-Scripts/master/Run_AR.bat)  

Now:  
 
Just run **NadekoBot.bat**  
 
Press 1 to download the latest version. Make sure that you made a Backup of everything. (Crendentials, Database file, etc.) 
 
These Scripts won't move your files, it'll delete your whole folder, so you'll have to make the backup yourself. 

Anyways, after downloading NadekoBot, you will have to set your Crendentials up.  

If you finished that already, just start the bot with either the Second or Third Option. (Normal startup or Auto Restart)
